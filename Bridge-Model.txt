Schedule activities while respecting equipment limits


goals:
	Minimize time to complete all activities

constraints :
	Each activity requires 1 of Required equipment

	The schedule must comply with the capacity limit defined for each equipment

	All activities are scheduled

	The schedule must respect the duration specified for each activity

	Schedule start is 2019/11/27 00:00:00

	Each activity starts after the end of Preceding activities

	No activity executed on Monday(s)


vocabulary rules:
	Table activity represents concept tasks of domain Scheduling
		
		Column Days defines the duration of task and is expressed in default duration unit
		
		Column Id is text (primary key)
		
		Column Preceding activities refers to table activity
		
		Column Required equipment refers to table equipment
		
	Table equipment represents concept resources of domain Scheduling
		Internal form: Definition of equipment as cSchedulingResource(inferred),
			requiredBy: equipment, activity, cDiscreteResourceCapacityLimitAlwaysConstraintSpez
		
	Table equipment represents concept resources of domain Scheduling
		
		Column Capacity defines the max capacity of resource
		
		Column Capacity defines the max capacity of resource
		
		Column Id is text (primary key)
		
		Column Id is text (primary key)
		
	Table wait
		
		Column After refers to table activity
		
		Column Before refers to table activity
		
		Column Description is text
		
		Column Max delay is numeric
		
		Column Min delay is numeric
		

data model :
	activity is a cTask 1.2(inferred):
		1:1 activity.Days as duration( internal type : NUMBER) specializes cTask 1.2.fixedDuration(user defined)
		(primary key)1:1 activity.Id as unclassified( internal type : STRING)
		0:n(0:n) activity.Preceding activities as activity
		0:1(1:n) activity.Required equipment as equipment
	
	equipment is a cSchedulingResource 1.2(inferred) and a cDiscreteResource 1.2(inferred):
		1:1 equipment.Capacity as capacity( internal type : NUMBER) specializes cSchedulingResource 1.2.maxCapacity(user defined)
		(primary key)1:1 equipment.Id as unclassified( internal type : STRING)
	
	wait:
		1:1(0:n) wait.After as activity
